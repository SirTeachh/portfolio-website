    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="brief">
        <p>
            A young, charismatic leader that is passionate about computer sciences. Leadership has always been one of my strongest qualities and is a skill I 
            have nurtured throughout my high school career. Not only that, a strong sense of discipline and good communication skills have carried me throughout 
            my learning career and have always helped when it comes to conflict resolution and building healthy relationships.<br>
            <br>
            The passion I have had for IT has been growing ever since I took it up as a subject in grade 10 and between then and the present I can proudly say I have 
            developed my coding skills in the following languages: Delphi, C#, SQL and HTML. I have not only dedicated my time to solely academics but have made it a point to 
            participate in activities that better me and my leadership skills. I have been privileged enough to be currently working as an A_STEP tutor at the University of 
            The Free State where I am tasked with facilitating tutorials for a programming module. I am blessed enough to be doing what I love whilst assisting other people 
            achieve their dreams.
